  "course_description": "This course will provide a gentle, yet intense, introduction to programming using Python for highly motivated students with little or no prior experience in programming. The course will focus on planning and organizing programs, as well as the grammar of the Python programming language.\n\nThe course is designed to help prepare students for [_6.01 Introduction to EECS I_](/courses/6-01sc-introduction-to-electrical-engineering-and-computer-science-i-spring-2011/). 6.01 assumes some knowledge of Python upon entering; the course material for 6.189 has been specially designed to make sure that concepts important to 6.01 are covered.\n\nThis course is offered during the Independent Activities Period (IAP), which is a special 4-week term at MIT that runs from the first week of January until the end of the month.",
